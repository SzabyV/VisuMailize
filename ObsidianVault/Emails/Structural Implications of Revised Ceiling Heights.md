Dear Team,

Following the MEP team's request for increased ceiling heights, weâ€™ve assessed the impact on the structural system. Adjusting floor heights by 20 cm is feasible, but it may slightly increase the steel tonnage and overall construction costs.

Please confirm if we should proceed with this change so we can update the structural drawings.

Best regards,
